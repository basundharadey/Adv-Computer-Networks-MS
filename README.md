Term Paper on An Acute Analysis And Advancement on SOS For Mitigating Intelligent DoS Attack.
In recent years, Internet Service (IS) is resonating in different industrial fields, e.g. banking, power stations, mission critical applications, defensive system etc., wherever one sector needs to distantly control over another sector. With increasing reliance of each other, sudden absence or termination of connection directly hits on our regular life. Here Denial of Services attack (DoS), driven by one or more multiple hosts in a way more harmonized manner has proven as a rapidly viable threat in today’s internet. Secure Overlay Services (SOS) acts as a premise to protect the time critical network disruption caused by Dos attack.
Although the architecture is promising in countering simple congestion based attacks, it is still dubious that if the architecture is really volatile to the intelligent Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) attack which aim to enact SOS to launch more vulnerability. So our intent in this paper to gauge the prospect of successful DDoS attack against a SOS protected network. This includes peer review of different intelligent attacks possible on SOS architecture and through that understanding more detail attacker’s strategy. It also encompass few schemes for enhancing SOS against the intelligent DDoS attack.
